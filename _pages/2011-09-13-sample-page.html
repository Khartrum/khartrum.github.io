<p id="internal-source-marker_0.640379817225039" dir="ltr">It’s The Neck</p>
<p dir="ltr">A fly sits on the cracked point of a black bull’s horn. The horn connects to the skull at a thick lump of meat. The bull’s head comes up. The insect lifts into the sky.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://bastardsoftheinfinite.com/khartrum/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/100_99072-700x950.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-42 alignright" title="100_99072-700x950" src="http://bastardsoftheinfinite.com/khartrum/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/100_99072-700x950.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="456" /></a>It is hot. The sun is going down. The dry dirt rises in sand colored clouds and carries past the fence to him. He’s dressed in yellow and blue. He says he’s The Matador, not a matador. People call him Lucky. He leans over the fence. The bull expands in the muddled air.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hey boy,” he says. Nothing. It doesn’t move. He whistles with his fingers. The bull looks up. Snorts. Shakes it’s head. Lucky sees the thick veins at the bull’s neck, like writhing black-snakes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Christ,” he mumbles. The bull goes to him. Lucky holds out his gloved hand. It pays him no mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The neck is the beast, he thinks. Hard blocks of dark fur-covered muscle shift and pull. Lucky turns around. He pushes the thin yellow mask up and wipes the sweat around his eyes. He looks out over the hill past the farm-house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not crazy, he thinks. I’m figuring it out.</p>
He spits at the dirt and pulls the yellow mask over his eyes, jumps the fence and lands in the hard sand. Black Bull looks up and then back to the dirt.
<p dir="ltr">He’s pretending. He sees me coming.</p>
Lucky stands still. The bull spins quickly to face him. Light comes through it’s gun-black eyes and brings out the red. The color leaks out in streaks across the bull’s wide shoulder and down it’s flank.
“Tear me down,” he says. His feet dig into the earth. He grips the fold on his short cape. Enough horns to satisfy the cash customers, he thinks. Smiles. The thing turns and comes through the air to reach him. It charges the cape. Lucky pivots left. The bull rushes in and stabs forward, changes directions and stabs at flapping yellow fabric.
Lucky leads the bull through a series of turns. The cape spins like a flower. It is a good bull. It knows the score. Lucky tosses the cape aside. The bull stops. snorts. They catch eyes.
<p dir="ltr">The fly lands on a yellow lock of Lucky’s hair. It rests there for a moment.</p>
“His neck,” it whispers.
“Show me,” he says. Lucky charges. He grabs the bull at the base of it’s horns. It shrugs him off, spins, knives aimed at the sand. The wide chest and then the dark underbelly cover above him. It blocks out the fading sun and the musk from hot sweat chokes Lucky at the collar, fills his nose and burns.
<p dir="ltr">You’ve lost it, kid! The old call of death pulls at his eyes. shut-down and dig a grave, psycho.</p>
Lucky rolls out and stands.
“Show me!”  He shouts it again.  He leaps forward and smashing his knuckles into the Bull’s head. Right between the ivory knives--tearing free a wailing sound, kicking it’s legs. Lucky takes a horn under the ribs. Black Bull lifts him into the air and tosses him to the earth. Matador holds the bloody hole in his side and stumbles clear of another pass, grabs the fence and swings himself over and into freedom. He drops flat, bleeding his guts into the ground. Above him the sky is dark.
<p dir="ltr">I’m figuring it out, he thinks. He wants to laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Panting over the torn yellow cape, Black Bull stands looking down at him. It expands in the muddled air.</p>
