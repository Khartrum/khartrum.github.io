<p style="text-align: left;">My good friend &amp; artist Joesph Colt Tenney made this illustration based on my short fiction <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-02/hartrum">MAGIC SOFT</a> that appeared in Tyomag #2. You can read that and other cool Tokyo works at <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-02">TYOmag.com</a>. This piece was made using gauche, zippy-tone and yellow paper for the flowers. Joseph is a comic book illustrator and visual artist. He lives in North Carolina, USA.</p>
