### KAKI SOUNDS COOL

John woke up at 11:00 am. It was raining. He could taste the meat between his teeth from the night before. _Stomach. It tastes like the stomach lining._ John stood and drank water from the faucet in the kitchen. He went to the freezer and ate two coconut cookies. They were very cold. He slid open the window and looked out at the rain over the river. The ducks were along the narrow gray banks. They were not moving. John made duck sounds and heard his roommate Dan mumble beyond the paper doors in the hall. “You hungry?”John asked. His roommate farted. John went to his room and sat down at his computer. He called his brother. It rang several times. There was no answer. John showered and sat in the kitchen and ate some cold rice and pickles from a plastic container. _I would like some coffee._ There wasn't any coffee. He went outside to his bicycle and wiped the seat with his sweater. It had been raining. The sky was grayish. He rode along the river to the busy street of Omekaido and went up towards Shinjuku station. The people he passed walked holding damp umbrellas. He stopped at Seven Eleven and bought a pork bun and a can of black coffee. He thumbed through some magazines and found a comic book about older women with large breasts lusting after younger men. A female character was having sex with a man wearing a tengu mask. John could not read most of the dialogue but the woman made moaning sounds that looked like ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

あああああ～

John’s roommate Dan was sitting on the black sofa in his dark room playing a video game. Dan was an Australian. He had lived in Tokyo for 5 years. 

“It’s getting cold outside,” John said. 

“Friend of friends. Where’ve you been?” Dan asked. 

“Reading comics at the combini. Ate a nikuman." 

“Porn comics?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Delicious nikuman?” 

"Always." John drank his beer and watched Dan kill zombie Nazis with a sniper rifle. 

“This game is a kind of ridiculous,” John said. 

“Why?” 

“Shooting games are just repetitive as hell.” 

“Street fighter is repetitive.” 

“Street fighter is beautiful. It’s pure. It’s the shining comet of modern competition.” 

“Fuck that. Street Fighter is brilliant but there are more complex things out there.” 

“The simplicity of Street Fighter is what makes it perfect,” John said. 

“The third one is perfect. The new one’s just OK.” Dan sighed. He started a new game. He said that he felt like ramen and a rim job. John laughed and went to his room and shut his door. He jerked off to a video of a girl having anal sex in a bathroom with a man wearing sunglasses. John was quiet because the walls were very thin. Dan turned up his video game in the next room. 

John went to the balcony and smoked a cigarette. It was night. He watched an old man climb onto the tin roof of a neighboring building and steal persimmons from the tree that hung near the second floor of their apartment. 

“Some guy is stealing the persimmons,” John said. 

“Some bum?” 

“Doesn't look like a bum,” he said. “Just some old guy and a kid.” 

The boy stood below the tree and collected the fruit into his shirt. 

“Maybe it’s his persimmon tree,” Dan said. 

“I doubt it. He’s running away now.” The man ran holding the child’s hand. The child held all the persimmons in the front of his shirt and was laughing as they turned down a narrow street towards the Kanda river.

At nine pm John walked along the river. There were trees hanging overhead. The nearly bare branches reached down and touched the water. Leaves were scattered along the path.  He stopped by a drink machine and bought a can of coffee with milk. It was hot. He tossed it between his hands until it cooled. People walked their small dogs that looked like small foxes and raccoons along the stone path. The trees drew shadows against the stone. He followed the river crossing Omekaido to the Nakano ward of Tokyo. It was not far. He bought a beer from a combini and stopped at a wellness park and did two sets of 10 pull-ups. He sat on a bench and watched people jogging. A girl and her dog walked past him. The girl looked at John from the corner of her eyes, quickening her pace. It was dark. I must look like a rapist. He walked under the trees. He did not know what kind of trees they were. John decided he should learn more about trees. He remembered the fat frogs that jumped across the brick sidewalk from the river during the summer.  A couple stood next to a drinking fountain near a small public bathroom. They were arguing. They spoke quickly. The girl cried on the man’s shoulder. She noticed John looking at her. She said something in the man’s ear. They walked away holding hands. John felt very alone and creeped out by the darkness. He thought about his brothers in Carolina for a moment and walked home on the opposite side of the river, watching the path ahead so that he would not step on any frogs. _Too cold for frogs, maybe._

John fried broccoli with garlic in a pan. He cracked 3 eggs over the broccoli and stirred it. His apartment was empty. He listened to American talk radio on the Internet. He boiled coffee and sat on his grass-mat floor and ate the eggs and broccoli. _I can’t taste it. I smoke too much, so I can’t taste anything._ He poured chili sauce on the eggs. The layer of sauce was very red and translucent. He went onto the balcony and drank the coffee. He smoked a cigarette and watched a boy and a girl ride their bikes in circles near the persimmon tree. “Yadda! Yadda!” a girl said. John looked at the persimmon tree. Kaki, he thought. Kaki sounds cool. “Kaki,” he said, blowing smoke as he spoke. John thought the persimmons looked ripe. A bird pecked some of the fruit. The meat inside was light-orange. John imagined a sunset from the 1980’s. _The sunset  poster on my parent’s wall in Florida when I was a baby._ _The rat and soccer-field lights._ John looked up and thought the sky was a good color. _Neon colors._
