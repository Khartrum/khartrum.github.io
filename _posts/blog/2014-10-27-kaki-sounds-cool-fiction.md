He went outside to his bicycle and wiped the seat with his sweater. It had been raining. The sky was grayish. He rode along the river to the busy street of Omekaido and went up towards Shinjuku station. The people he passed walked holding damp umbrellas. He stopped at Seven Eleven and bought a pork bun and a can of black coffee. He thumbed through some magazines and found a comic book about older women with large breasts lusting after younger men.
