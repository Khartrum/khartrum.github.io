title: I Interviewed Artist Shi Shi Yamazaki for TYO
---


I was able to convince Shi Shi Yamazaki to take part in an [interview](http://tyoindex.com/2013/09/conversations-with-people-we-like-8-shishi-yamazaki/) before her new show opened up at ROCKET in Harajuku last week. 

ShiShi: I was born and grew up in the suburbs of Tokyo. I was very talkative, and I used to make bunny ears or something like baikin manâ€™s ears (a character from a famous TV show for children, Anpanman ) and wore them to school.
