## From Taj Mahal

It was cool outside and the smell and sound of the sea revived my senses and washed the thick oil of the evening from my face. I wanted to sprint to the water. I did not and walked holding a plastic bottle of shitty Old Crow down to the boardwalk. There were many people out, and I walked to be alone. I reached the sand where the light from the boardwalk faded. I saw a figure walking in the distance and thought it could have been John. The sky was a dark blue, and the ocean a blackness. It roared and hummed to me and I walked quickly, gaining on him. I felt whiskey on my wrist. Sounds from between the black lips of Poseidon in the dark. Growling at me. Dooming.
