I wake at 1:30 pm on a Saturday. I am still wearing blue jeans. Andrew is standing above me repeating the question “Are you alive?”

“What are you talking about?” I grumble. “I’m fine.”

“Look at your pillow,” he says.

I sit up and turn to find splashes of maroon colored blood across the faded-white of my 1,000 yen MUJI pillow.

“I have to buy a new pillow,” I say.

I reach back and feel the dampness of the large cut running an inch and a half in length on the back of my head. It is bleeding.

“Naoki just called me. He’s got a black eye. He said you cracked your head open,” Andrew says.

"I can't remember a damn thing," I say.

"Seems that you wouldn't," he says.

After a brief period of denial, I decide to put forth my best effort and recite the order of the night:

- Took the train to Shibuya sipping on a water-bottle filled with vodka.
- Met Andrew, Naoki, and others at a place called ECHO.
- Ordered shot of whiskey and a bottle of domestic beer.
- Viewed nude photograph of unknown girl on wall.
- Smoked several cigarettes.
- Walked to Karaoke with an entertaining group people who seemed to share common bond of having worked at American Apparel and/or liking DJs.
- Sang Blue Suede Shoes by Elvis Presley.
- Drank several mugs of cheap beer.
- Sang China Girl by David Bowie.
- Drank beer.
- Went to a bar on the third floor.
- MISSING
- MISSING
- MISSING
- Woke in blue-jeans stained with blood.

I call Naoki. He is sitting in front of his computer. His nose is swollen. The skin around his eye is large and purple.

“You look great,” I say.

“I am a one-eyed panda,” he says.

“You need to even it out.”

“You were drunk,” he says. I tried to help you down the stairs but you fell and pulled me with you.”

“You are a loyal friend.”

“My nose is broken,” he says.

"Did I mention you look very cool as a panda?"

I get in the shower. The side of my head is sore. I imagine my skull to be purple, grey and black. I hang my head under the hot water and watch it quickly turn shades of pink as it washes through my hair and around my face, and then spinning into the drain.

I go to Mcdonald’s and order a Big Mac and two large fries. The person sitting next to has ordered a Big Mac meal and a pack of chicken nuggets. The Big Mac is an appreciated confidant. Its soft bread covers my teeth and cools my head. It warms my gutless insides. Even far away across the sea, its regenerative powers are known and celebrated.

“Wish I wouldn’t have tumbled down those stairs,” I think. "At least I probably didn’t look foolish lying in a puddle of blood at the bottom of the stairs in front of all those people."

Walking along Ome Avenue pushing a damp, bloodied bandage to the back of my skull, I am afforded a swarm of menacing premonitions of possible and immediate futures including: coma, death, brain swelling, hospitalization and utter humiliation. The world is a stinking two inch gash. I am the dastardly orangutan prince who cannot keep his fingers from it.

I finger the cut on my head while I chastise myself for touching it. The girl from last night calls me on my computer. She looks sleepy and pretty.

"You're alive," she says. She explains how I hollered and insulted the ambulance driver who tried to help me. She tells me that I slept in my blood and how it was probably mixed with Naoki's blood and that I wouldn't wake up for some time.

“I'm an idiot,” I say.

“You rubbed my ass while telling me how sorry you were,” she says.

“I am really sorry.”

“You said that last night."

I apologize three more times and tell her I don’t remember a thing.

“It’s OK,” she says. “It was funny.”

“Your ass might have saved my life,” I say. “Please say thank you to your ass.”

She leans back and whispers something behind her.

“The ass says <em>Grrrrrrrrr</em>, but you’re welcome.”
