<span style="color: #333333;"><em>—Every year our gang travels, in an erratic caravan, to the barrier islands of the Outer Banks, those losing strips of North Carolina locked in an unceasing decay between the unmoving sounds and wearing forces of the Atlantic. The excursions began in the spring of 2002 (assorted Carolina beaches, North and South) and have continued for 10 years, which may not seem long, but the photographs depicting the decline of our youth present the illusion of considerable length.</em></span>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><span style="color: #333333;">WAYFARING</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #333333;">Just arrived at charlotte airport, having flown from Tokyo to Detroit and from there to CLT. More than 30 hours in transit. Sweating and dirty. Sleepless. Waiting for my black duffel bag to appear from a hole in the wall as I picture the water, shining light, heat of the sun, beer dripping down my chest.</span></p>
<span style="color: #333333;">Exit the airport and experience the painful sensation of humidity across my face and arms. A heavy, old man smokes a cigarette behind me on a bench. Smells like shit. I want a cigarette. Quitting when I hit 29. Got a week left. A pretty mixed girl with an ass like a dream stands near the curb, waiting for her ride. Curved hips rock sideways under tight, black denim to music playing through her tiny earphones. Haven't seen shapes like that  in a while. Carolina in the spring. Love that phrase.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">“Carolina in the spring,” I mumble. Mix girl turns around and gives me a “quit staring at my ass” look. I search the cars pulling through to arrivals and up the parking deck where the sun breaks in a straight line on the road. <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a69UuI_vBnrTcy4mjroFFE3HexzX6SnZCqnKJIH1YlRGqaMDEDeyb2SRV74c0f5TikPzE2EoIWz8yDWxSCknC7PS25D8qTu4aU8dd9G-tZCpBoJ8flA" alt="" width="1px;" height="1px;" /><!--more--></span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Gleaming, cobalt-blue hyundai speeds towards me and stops, honking twice.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "You looking for a good time?" a familiar voice asks from the driver seat.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "I guess so," I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> Toss my things in the trunk, and pushing  into the small backseat behind my old friend Matt, who's driving. Mikey's riding shotgun, bearded and grinning behind a pair of sunglasses.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Tired, buddy?” Matt asks in his usual understated manner.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I need a shower.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “No time for showers, man. Got eight hours of road ahead of us,” Mikey says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I’ve been on the move forever.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Be there before you know it, man.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “To the beach," I say.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I-85 North towards Concord, passing Highpoint, Chapel Hill and Durham. I-40 East to Rocky Mount. The sun is shinning and hot through the windows with the smell of exhaust and cut grass. Endless road signs and the rolling flora of N.C.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">"Damn Outer Banks is too damn far," I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "The beach is there. We just gotta keep movin," Mikey says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Too bad most everyone's broke," Matt says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">"Gonna be fuckin beautiful."</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">The hours pass. We stop at the usual Wendy’s. I order a Spicy chicken sandwich and french fries, which look different than I remember. The chicken patty seems inflated and a brighter shade of orange. The fries are brown in places. I pay with a ten thousand yen note. The pretty plump girl behind the counter stares at it, wrinkling her nose.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “What is this?” she asks.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I say ‘oops’ and hand her a ten dollar bill.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I’m really tired. Just flew in from Japan,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Ok,” she says, not giving a shit where the hell I’m coming from. I carry my unfamiliar chicken and fries to the table, feeling like an idiot.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I bite into the sandwich. The texture is different but the flavors remain: Mayo, bread, lettuce, cayenne, onion, paprika and tomato. Warming.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Outside in the parking lot I drink cold cola, crunching the ice between my teeth. Citrus color of the late afternoon sun sets behind the adjoining gas station.  I smoke a cigarette with Mikey as Matt waves it out of his face, angrily cursing. He used to smoke and hates it.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “God damn it, get that shit out of my eyes,” he says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Suck it up, young lady.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> Matt steps forward twice and moves his arms aggressively, letting out a masculine “Kee-ya!” I laugh and hug him below the arms, lifting him into the air at the waist. He grabs me around the neck, choking me. Mikey tells us to get in the damn car. He’s driving. We take off and I’m in and out of sleep.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A dream about curling a dumbbell that is too heavy to lift. I drop it and wake, kicking the seat in front of me before the fictive weight smashes the bones in my shoeless foot.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Talk radio about the undeniable connection of the city and her food. Songs about the water to inspire our moods.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"><em>The lonely sea, It never stops, For you or me, It moves along, From day to day, </em><em>That’s why my love (oooo-oooo-oooo), That’s why my love (oooo-oooo-oooo) You’ll never stay (oooo-oooo-oooo)</em></span>

<span style="color: #333333;">US- 64 East until we reach the Virginia Dare Memorial bridge, passing the Croatan and Roanoke sounds, which barely move as the wind pushes across the top.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Look at the sound. Fuckin beautiful,” Mikey says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “We never stay on the sound side. I think it’s more expensive,” Matt replies.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I just like that a sound is called a sound,” I say. Matt tosses an empty paper cup and it bounces off the top of my head.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We reach the islands. Another hour riding down 12 south before the beach town of Salvo, which is nothing more than a handful of restaurants, surf shops, holiday rentals, and a few permanents for the townies. It is the same as ever. The beach. All trips are the next production, continuing on and on. There is no year, but the beach crumbles further, little pieces washing away towards Spain and the tip of Morocco.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">It is dark. We find our house and park the car under the basket ball hoop. The place is called Wave Reviews. Beach houses are always like that: Dune Nothing, Shore Thang, Beachy Keen. Climbing the wooden stairs to the front door carrying whiskey and a case of beer. They’re all in there, drinking in the living room (high slanted ceiling), smoking on the porch (large one facing the Atlantic), standing in the kitchen taking shots of something (gold in color. Tequila, maybe).</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">There are twelve of us including my brothers, who approach me in order of age.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “You tired, brother?” Dustin asks.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Sup, brother,” Adam says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Oh great, brother’s here,” Jamey says sarcastically.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> We embrace and repeat old jokes between us. Still funny. Adam hooks his phone to a pair of speakers on the tall table near the window.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Rock it,” he says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Cock it,” Jamey says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I open a beer.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;"><em>It’s automatic when I talk with old friends the conversation turns to girls we knew when their hair was soft and long and the beach was the place to go...</em></span>

<span style="color: #333333;">They are dancing. Brother Adam and other Adam join arms, singing the doo, doo, doo’s of the refrain near the girl named Amanda who executes a sincere portrayal of the twist while spilling something pink and from a champagne flute across the top of her foot.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I pour whiskey over ice into a plastic Bud Light cup. I am delirious but my whiskey, friends, and brothers offer an overwhelming amount of emotion, which becomes excitement, which becomes hysteria.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">“Let’s go to the Beach,” Dustin says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Beach,” someone says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Beach,” someone says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Beach.”</span>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><span style="color: #333333;">THE LONELY SEA</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #333333;">We’re all out near the dunes in a circle. The waves break lightly on wet, hard sand. Stars are visible in bright swirls of grey and blue.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I never see the stars in Tokyo,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Feels like you’re in outer space if you look straight up and cover your ears,” Dustin says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I look up and cover my ears. Muffled laughter though my fingers. I focus on clusters of distant light. Pretty, sparkling dust clouds circle sharp points in blue and black.</span></p>
<span style="color: #333333;">Some of us are down by the tide. I walk over and feel the cool water up to my ankles.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Pretty cold,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Should be warmer than last year,” someone says. “Came a month later this time.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Thank God for that. That house was cheaper but too cold in May.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> The wind blows with great force across the beach and kicks up the loose sand, spraying our legs. We move away from the water.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We walk in circles drinking beers and discuss friends who could not or would not come. I finish a beer and take pictures of my brother Dustin near the water.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "It looks cool. You're a beach ghost." I show him the image.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "They're too dark," He says.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">The sand starts up again, stinging my legs.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Feels like bees."</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Fuck."</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I’m heading back,” I say.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">It is pitch-black. The crash of the waves and laughter fade as I walk through the dunes, sipping a warm beer. Keep off the dunes, I think. I can’t see where I’m going as I struggle to follow the faint glow of window-light through the trees, holding my can of beer and an empty BUD LIGHT cup. I do my best to avoid the sand-spurs.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Awake in the early afternoon. Shafts of light are placed through broken venetian blinds. It is hot. Four people are still asleep in the room with me. I don’t remember the end of the night. A girl named Stephanie mumbles something.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "What?" I ask.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> She is asleep, softly breathing.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Upstairs there are people scattered around the living room on sofas, nursing hangovers, playing street fighter, eating, and drinking coffee.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> My brother Adam is in the kitchen toasting waffles. His large, curly hair is thick and does not move when he moves.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Who you making waffles for?” I ask and touch his curls.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Me and Babe,” he says. Babe is his girlfriend: a short, blond girl named Kate. She sits at a computer holding her half pomeranian/ half chihuahua mix named Pepe who will continue to gift small, sausage sized shits across the house for the remainder of the trip.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "I don't want my own waffle. I just want a bite of yours," she says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Okay, Babe."</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I lie on the sofa (coarse sand beneath my legs). Play multiple rounds of Street Fighter with varying results. No mind. Hungry for bacon. Smell of the salty fat carries through the room.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I fry bacon and eggs for myself and brother Jamey.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “You like hot sauce,” I ask?</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Nah,” Jamey says. His hair is straight like mine, but lighter in color. “Want me to microwave some pancakes?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Can you microwave pancakes?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Yeah, dude,” he says taking a box from the freezer. “Taste pretty good for frozen pancakes.” He places four cold, hard pancakes on a plate and puts them in the microwave. "Wait till you taste them."</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I splash hot sauce across my over-medium eggs fried in bacon grease and eat them quickly with a microwaved pancake. Brother Dustin stands at the coffee machine. He looks tired and serious about making the coffee. His curls are like Adam’s, but smaller.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I need a cup,” I say and put a piece of bacon into his mouth. “I made that for you. None left.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Thanks. It’s almost done,” he says. “The last pot was shit.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Coffee is a serious business,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Mikey can’t make a pot of coffee to save his life,” he says. “Too strong.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> Mikey comes up and yells at everyone about the beach.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Goin to the beach!” he yells. “15 minutes!”</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We smoke cigarettes on the screened-in porch. The family next door to us has a pool. We discuss the need for a pool. Maybe next year, we say. If only people had money, we say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> A young girl in a white bathing suit lies on a towel near the shallow end of the clear water.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “How old do you think she is,” Brian asks, pushing up the red bill of his ball cap.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Maybe 16,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I am gonna swim in that pool before we leave,” Mikey says. “10 minutes. Beach.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Could be 18,” I say. “I guess she looks younger from far away, because she’s so small.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> The sun shines brightly over the pool-water and the young, reflective girl beside it.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “15 minutes. Beach,” Mikey says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "You said 10 minutes 5 minutes ago," I tell him.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "20 minutes, people. Beach."</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I fill a plastic shopping bag with cans of Miller High Life and pour tequila and juice over ice into a plastic Bud Light cup. I take my towel (blue and green illustrations of dolphins and pixelated light shining against sea stones) and my brother’s copy of Nine Stories.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">The sun heats the black asphalt. Sweat rolling down my neck as I cross through the trees and over the hot dunes, flipping sand against my calves and up my swimming trunks. It’s quiet, save the clicking of my sandals. Sound of the ocean swells as I walk. Hot light. Ahead there is only sand, as the hills unfold and then between the sloping roundness of the dunes, I see them on towels near the water. Jay, the great organizer of the house, has released a burgundy bocce ball into the air. I track it in an arc before it smashes into the sand, rolling towards the tiny, white jack buried in the warm ground near my bag of beers.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">“Who wants to play?” Jay asks. “It’s simple and fun.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I’ll play,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “A tournament!” Mikey yells. His beard is spattered with chunks of sun-block. “Me and Brian are the Bravos. The Bravos are taking the pennant,” he says. Mikey and Brian hum the Atlanta Braves war chant while moving their arms in cadence, chopping slowly through the air.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Your face looks like you were eating a jar of Mayonnaise,” Brian says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Gotta hit those problem areas, baby,” Mikey rubs the lotion into his head, smiling.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We play back and forth between the dunes. The games are short. We argue about distance and rules. Nobody knows how to play. I gloat about my team’s technique and the heavy green, gold, blue and red bocce play across the sand.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">“No bocce, no life,” Dustin says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “He who controls the bocce controls the universe,” Jay yells.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “What we talk about when we talk about bocce.”</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I fall into  my towel and pull a beer out of a small styrofoam cooler. I drink it and read a story called Down at the Dingy. It is hot. Matt is lying near me. He looks over his sunglasses, stoned eyes under dirty-blonde hair searching the pages of the book.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “What is that?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Down at the Dingy.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Going down on a Dingy?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “A famous short story. This one is appropriate now because it describes sunlight and cool water,” I say.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Show me the sunlight and cool water," Matt says.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">“<em>--The sun, though not especially hot, was nonetheless so brilliant that it made any fairly distant image--a boy, a boat--seem almost as wavering and refractional as a stick in water."</em></span>

<span style="color: #333333;">I finish reading and look back at him. He lies motionless, eyebrows raised. I can see my sunglasses in his sunglasses.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “I just never got into that kind of book,” he says. A seagull hops close to our towels, twichting at the neck. I kick the air and it lifts into the wind.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “What kind of story?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “The whole slice of life thing.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “It’s pretty damn popular,” I say. “Read one of these and tell me it doesn’t do something for you.”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “We’ll see,” he says. Sips his beer and looking back at the ocean... maybe shutting his eyes. “Refractional as a stick in the water,” he says.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Ha,” I yell, pointing at him. "It’s in you."</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "Nope," he says and covers his face with a t-shirt.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> I laugh and look around at my friends. Shocking, radiant sunlight shines brightly on pale, suburned skins as they run or lie over the sand.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">"Get yourself in that cool, cool water," Adam yells from  the tide. He walks with our brothers and his girl, Kate. I raise my thumb into the air.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> "I'm coming!” I say. Heavy and drunk. Gonna be cold, I think. Drink the rest of my beer. Sprinting towards them and screaming “FUCK” like some kind of idiot as the water swallows me, the world tumbling in circles. Fear of sharks. Sea shells on my back. Standing into the air as another wave smacks me from behind with a loud <em>crack</em>.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Took the breath out of you, huh?”</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"> “Yes,” I say with water dripping past my closed eyes. “It did.”</span>
