We released the second issue of Tokyo based art and literary magazine known as <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-02">TYOmag.com</a>. It has been a relative success, attracting attention from some notable artists and a few quality digital publications. This issue is called KABUKICHO.  It contains paintings, poetry, short fiction, photography and sequential art by Tokyo based artists. I included a chapter from a long piece of fiction I've been working on. You can read that short story called <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-02/hartrum">MAGIC SOFT</a> and see everything else at <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-02">TYOmag.com</a>. The site's new look and navigation feels really clean, and for that I thank my TYO colleague &amp; co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ADRegan">Duncan Regan</a>.
