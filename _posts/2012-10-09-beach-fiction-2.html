I recently published a short story on <a href="http://tyomag.com/">TYO</a>. It's a piece of Beach fiction I wrote over the summer. I originally wrote it as a chapter for a longer piece called BIG TIME. The excerpt is called <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-01/excerpt-from-big-time/">The Skinny Girl with Big Tits, Shonan and You Can Take New York.Â </a>

You can read it <a href="http://tyomag.com/issue-01/excerpt-from-big-time/">here</a>.
