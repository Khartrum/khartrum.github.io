Prologue:

We see tight shot of a poster of an attractive Idol.

CUT TO

Tight shot of Kid Tiger. He is breathing heavily in rhythm.

CUT TO

Again we see the poster. It is clear that the tiger is focusing on the image of the woman in front of him.

</div>
<div>

CUT TO

We finally see that the Kid Tiger is curling weights. He stands in front of the poster for inspiration. We see a close-up of the girl's face. She is smiling, playfully...as if mocking him to become stronger so that he may obtain her.
we move closer to the eye of our hero. There is a mad intensity within.

CUT TO

The screen is black for an extended period of time. We hear classical music, which will become the theme.
(something like MAURICE RAVEL: BOLERO or Prelude op 23 No 5: Rachmaninoff)

Possible b-roll of random people on the subway. A young woman is riding a Tokyo metro train. She stands facing the doors preparing to exit. The train is crowded.

The girl stands outside of the station. Kid Tiger cannot make out her face. The view of her zooms in quickly and becomes a very tight shot. We see her face for the first time. It glows for him.

The girl is pretty and fair skinned. She is looking around, possibly waiting for someone.

3c. EXT. MONTAGE OF AROUSAL:

Kid Tiger is nervous and excited:
His nostrils flair.
He crushes the half-drank milk carton. Milk spills out over his fingers and onto the pavement.
A bead of sweat rolls down his neck.

We see the man who she was waiting for. It is her lover. They embrace.

The girl and the man kiss. Time slows.
<p dir="ltr">KID TIGER</p>
<p dir="ltr">Murmer’s the word: FUCK</p>
