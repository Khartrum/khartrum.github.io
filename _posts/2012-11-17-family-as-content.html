Three attractive Americans in their mid to late twenties pose for a photograph in a San Francisco bar wearing dapper nightwear in the 1960s. This is part of a meditative hunt for old, pretty photographs of my family as young men and women. The prize inspires in me a sentimental longing for the past and motivation for an aesthetically interesting future. America's trendy infatuation with "corrupting" nostalgia may have something to do with this, but now the conversation is old hat. We live in a period of time where all times are accessible and fair game. Everything is on the table, as is the recurrence of used angles such as accessing familial history in order to write creative narratives. It has been done forever and everywhere. The device has been a classical source of inspiration in most creative mediums since the dawn of the portrait and modern narrative, but doing it right and uniquely is the catch.

The above photograph of my (from left to right) Grandfather Frank, Grandmother Francis and their dear friend Bud Crum (at the Red Balloon in San Francisco 1964) was the inspiration for a short story called <em>Danceland/1954</em> which I wrote years ago, and although that youthful prose is riddled with laughable attempts at cool and amateurish lines, the actual story Frank told me over coffee or beer on the porch or in the kitchen (can't accurately recall so I'll rewrite it) is alive and in the shared space of our collective memory and remains a legend in my mind.<!--more-->

<em>Cooper and big Bud Anderson and the others had come up from Lima, but it was apparent from their clothes that they’d spent time in Dayton or Toledo. Coop had on his new, favorite Prussian-blue suit, and both Bud and Coop walked with  in a confident swagger just ahead of  Carmen French and the young Mike Sims who’d never really been “out” on account of him just turning seventeen.</em>

<em>“Now just hold yourself together, Mike,” Coop said looking at his friend. “You just keep an eye on Bud here and watch him do his thing.” Cooper kept loose cigarettes in the side-pocket of his jacket. He removed one with his smallish hand and motioned Bud for a light. Bud lit his own, then tossed the lighter. They were just near the front door. The sign buzzed and crackled above them. It read: DANCELAND in big, garish letters.</em>

<em>“Danceland?  My mother would have my ass if she knew I...” then young Mike Sims was quiet having heard the screams of pleasure and looking out over the water at the large wooden roller coaster which was adorned with bright yellow bulbs, and the line of carts crawled slowly to the highest peak and then dropped down over the beach, lending a dim-yellow glow to the still water of Indian Lake."</em>

Nobody wants their existence to fade, and the death of second-hand memories and stories which were the beginnings of the present ME are the flowery details--a seemingly endless trove of adventures, jokes, love, death, sex, heartbreak and 2nd, 3rd and 4th hand stories. Tell the stories which save the people and thus, separating us further from the fear of dying.

Grandpa Frank is 29 in this photograph--the age I am now. In 1964 and 2012, two young men of same blood pose for photographs in metropolitan drinking holes on opposite sides of the planet, 48 years apart. Within this recognition of timeless similarity, among long gone cocktails and those not yet poured comes a reconstruction of my identity. Must find skinny tie. Must polish shoes.

On a warm evening in May, a cool character I never met named Bud Crum convinced my grandfather to pull his car over and flirt with two young girls walking down the street in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima,_Ohio">Lima, Ohio</a>. Bud's hunch was right on and the girls responded in spades. Because of this meeting (among others) I am alive and typing these words which will reinforce my concept of self. Of course, the importance of whether or not the story becomes something beautiful in its retelling...that's where the work is. Bite down. Write a story. Paint a picture. Save yourself.

R.I.P Bud Crum
